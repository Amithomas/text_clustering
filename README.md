## Useful tools in text analysis:

### Document clustering
Implemented in `simple_text_recognition.py`.
Simple K-mean algorithm used to cluster texts data set.
This algorithm could be used to predict classification in new data.

### Stemming
Implemented in `stemming.py`.
Sklearn Vectorizer class has not steeming implemented.
So we can use nltk modules to add this functionality and also create our special tokenizer adding our own rules.
